# Tic Tac Toe

#### Why?

This repo is just for me to see how ~~badly~~ I can code programming languages that I know/am learning.
Some languages will have some implementation of a minimax algorithm, depends on how comfortable I am with the language.
Every dynamically typed language will have strict type checking.

None of this code was written by Copilot, ChatGPT, or anyone else.
